/*81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

You are given a rotated sorted array nums (possibly containing duplicates) and an integer target.
Return true if target exists in nums, otherwise false.
The goal is to minimize the number of operations.

ðŸ”¹ Example 1
Input:
nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0

Output:
true

ðŸ”¹ Example 2
Input:
nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3

Output:
false

ðŸ”¹ Code Explanation

This is an extension of the rotated sorted array search (Problem 33), but with duplicates allowed.
Standard binary search is used with modifications:
If arr[mid] == target, return true.
If arr[low] == arr[mid] == arr[high], we canâ€™t decide which half is sorted â†’ shrink search space (low++, high--).
Otherwise, if left half is sorted (arr[low] <= arr[mid]):
Check if target lies in left half â†’ adjust high.
Else â†’ move low.
If right half is sorted:
Check if target lies in right half â†’ adjust low.
Else â†’ move high.
Continue until low > high.

Time Complexity: O(log n) in average case, but can degrade to O(n) in worst case (due to duplicates).
Space Complexity: O(1)
